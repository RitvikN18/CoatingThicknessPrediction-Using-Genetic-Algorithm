# CoatingThicknessPrediction-Using-Genetic-Algorithm

This repository is the implementation of the paper "Neural networks and genetic algorithms for the evaluation of coating thicknesses in thermal barriers by infrared thermography data". The implementation in this repository is performed using privately generated data.


The data we have is a CSV created from the images taken from a thermal camera. The CSV file contains a series of temperatures, and the coating thickness value for this temperatures. 


The paper presents a neural networks training method using pre-preprocessing of data by principal component analysis (PCA) to optimize the number of network inputs and the genetic algorithm to determine the optimum initial weights in network training by back propagation.
